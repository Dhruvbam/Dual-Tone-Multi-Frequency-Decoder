## About
The DTMF Decoder is a Python-based tool developed to decode digits from audio signals generated by telephone keypads. The project employs Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques to analyze dual-tone frequencies and identify numeric or symbolic inputs (0-9, *, #). This project highlights foundational skills in signal processing, real-time data analysis, and Python programming.

## Description
The DTMF Decoder processes WAV audio files to decode telephone keypad digits by analyzing the distinct dual-tone frequencies associated with each keypress. It uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for efficient frequency decomposition, allowing it to match audio signals with the standard DTMF frequency table. Noise-filtering techniques are implemented to ensure accuracy even in noisy environments, resulting in an effective and reliable decoder. This project emphasizes my ability to work with real-world audio data, leveraging Python libraries like NumPy and SciPy for frequency analysis and signal processing.

## Features & Technical Details

- **Real World Audio Decoding:** Accurately decodes telephone keypad dial tones from WAV files and maps it to digits and symbols (0-9, *, #).
- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** Utilizes Fast Fourier Transform to analyze frequency spectra for each audio segment, matching detected tones to DTMF standards.
- **Noise Filtering:** Implements advanced Digital Signal Processing and noise filtering techniques to reliably identify tones, even in noisy recordings.
- **End-to-End Audio Pipeline:** Covers audio synthesis, analog to digital conversion, detailed frequency analysis, and digit mapping.
- **Hands On Jupyter Workflow:** Step by step code in Python Notebooks encourages experimentation and interactive learning.
- **Data Science Focus:** Integrates visualizations, robust data handling and reinforcing experimentation and analytical debugging in a data science throughout the project.
